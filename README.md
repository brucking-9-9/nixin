# nixin

Package and option installer for NixOS + Home Manager flake configs. One CLI with
a `--json` contract; a TUI and a GUI sit on top of it.

It is built for a config that lives in a git repo with several hosts
(`nixosConfigurations.<host>`) and Home Manager users, where the authoritative
checkout is root-owned and the person edits a user-owned workspace clone.
nixin edits the workspace, builds and diffs there without root, and does the
privileged part — commit into the authoritative checkout and `nixos-rebuild
switch` — as one explicit step.

Inspired by [search.nixos.org], [Home Manager Option Search], [NixHub] /
[nix-versions], [nix-search-tv], [Noogle], [NüschtOS Search] and [Searchix]; it
talks to the first few and borrows the local-eval idea from NüschtOS.

## Layers

| layer | answers | from |
|---|---|---|
| **discovery** | what exists, in which versions | search.nixos.org (packages, NixOS options, programs), Home Manager options, NixHub version history, noogle; `nix search` on the host's *locked* nixpkgs as the exact-rev fallback |
| **truth** | what *this* host has | `nix eval` of the config flake: installed packages, every option's current value and `declarations` (file:line), lock rev, generation |
| **writer** | how to change it | new things go to generated `installer/*.nix` (nixfmt'd, from `state.json`); removing or changing something a hand-written module declares edits that module in place |
| **apply** | make it so | `plan` = build + `nix store diff-closures`; `apply` = commit into the authoritative checkout + switch (sudo); `sync` = push/pull the config hub repo |

Why two kinds of search: search.nixos.org indexes channel-*latest*, so a hit can
name a version your `flake.lock` does not have yet. The truth layer evaluates
your own flake, which is what makes this an installer rather than another
search box — it knows what would actually change.

## CLI

```
nixin [--json] [--host H] VERB [ARGS...]

search info versions        discovery
status where                truth
add rm set unset            writer
plan apply sync             apply
```

With `--json` every verb prints exactly one document:
`{"ok": true, "verb": ..., "host": ..., ...}` or
`{"ok": false, "verb": ..., "error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}`.
Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 verb failed (JSON error printed) · 2 usage. Nothing
prompts; privileged steps fail with `needs-sudo` and the command to run.

## Develop

```
nix develop            # python, pytest, ruff, nixfmt
pytest                 # or: nix build  (runs the tests in checkPhase)
nix run . -- --json status
nix fmt
```

Consume from a config flake: add `nixin` as an input and
`nixpkgs.overlays = [ nixin.overlays.default ]`, then `pkgs.nixin`.

## Status

Skeleton: the CLI contract and the package build. The layers land in order,
discovery → truth → writer → apply, each with `--json` and tests, tested on a
second machine before touching the main one.
